# Overview

SDK modules are an alternative to the [otel4s-oteljava][oteljava] implementation.
All modules are implemented in Scala and available for all platforms: JVM, Scala Native, and Scala.js.
The implementation remains **experimental** and some functionality may be lacking.

The SDK modules were moved to a separate repo: https://typelevel.org/otel4s-sdk/sdk/overview.html.
